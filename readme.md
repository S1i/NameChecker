<h1>🤖 Username Checker 🤖</h1>

This was made for educational & learning purposes only. I do not recommend using this to get a username.

<h2>📂 Requirements 📂</h2>

Download the following resources.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Words.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorenbrichter/Words/master/Words/en.txt) Download this, change the name to "words.json" and put it in the folder with the rest of the files.

<h2>📮 How to use 📮</h2>

Use the following commands in a terminal in the folder of these files.
- ``npm init``
- ``npm install chalk@4.1.2``
- ``npm install node-fetch@1.7.3``

<h2>📔 Information & Notes 📔</h2>

- When a username is said as un-used or available it may be useable or banned.
- Use at your own risk.
